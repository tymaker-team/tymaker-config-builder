# tymaker
Generates Thank-You notes from information
This is a very basic c# program that I made in 3 hours at school. It can be used for writing thank-you notes, although it it is not finished. A stable release will be posted soon.
# Building Instructions
## Github Actions
The easiest way to use the program is to download the latest build from [![Tymaker Builds](https://github.com/Anti-Apple4life/tymaker-group/actions/workflows/tymaker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Anti-Apple4life/tymaker-group/actions/workflows/tymaker.yml).
## Using `dotnet`
You can build to your own liking using the `dotnet` command. This offers more control than using the Makefile and downloading a build.
## Using `make`
The easiest way to build tymaker yourself is to use the Makefile included. Simply clone this repository, enter the repository folder, and type in `make`. A folder called `publish` will be created, and the build will be there.
## Installing
After using `make`, you can type in `sudo make install` to install the build in the `publish` folder to your `/usr/bin` directory.
# Disclaimer
All new features are tested on Arch Linux, so no guarantees it will work anywhere else. I also cannot guarantee that it will work at all (Thanks MIT license)
